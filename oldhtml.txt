                    <p>
                        Hi! My name is Dustin La and I am majoring in Computer Science with a Minor in IT at the New Jersey Institute of Technology.
                        <br></br>
                        Nice to meet you :)
                        <span class = "card__read-more">
                            <br></br>
                            In Summer 2021 and 2022, I worked as an Orientation Leader for NJIT's New Student Orientation and help guided over 1,600 incoming students support their educational and personal goals
                            <br></br>
                            From end of the semester Spring 2021 to Fall 2022, I was of the event coordinators for the NJIT Student Activities Council and I helped establish and facilitate 17 school-wide events for 500+ students
                            <br></br>
                            These positions helped with my time management, teamwork, and leadership skills. I'm looking to make an impact in a software development position that will allow me to apply and enhance my programming skills.

                                    Created during the HackNJIT 2022 Hackathon by Adrianna Rust, Andrew Dickman, Dustin La, and Hrishikesh Sakunala
                                    <br> </br>
                                    <b>-- Best Camping Themed Hack Winner -- </b>
                                    <br> </br>
                                    Used Python with the Pygame library to create a game where a user toasts their marshmallow to a scrumptious golden brown.
                              
                                    Choose a duration of short, medium, or long to toast your marshmallow over the campfire.
                              
                                    Based on this duration, you will toast your marshmallow and get it closer to Golden Brown!
                              
                                    But be careful, too much toasting will burn your marshmallow.
                              
                                    Continue to toast golden brown marshmallows to increase your streak and go for a high score!

                            Users play a simple HTML game for points and can register accounts to save their scores.  Users can create public and private profiles as well as competitions to challenge
                            other users. There is also a weekly, monthly, and lifetime scoreboard for the game. For users with admin privileges, 
                            they can create roles, edit competitions, and assign other users as admins.

                            I was one of the Event Coordinators for the Student Activities Council. I use my event planning, budgeting, volunteer mangement, communication, and teamwork skills to host successful events.
                            I have contacted agencies for different acts and supplies to help run 500+ person, school-wide events.
                            These events include Do It Yourself (DIY) Days, Game Shows, Movie Nights, and more!
                        <span class = "card__read-more">
                            The New Jersey Institute of Technology Student Activity Council (SAC) is a group of fun-loving and 
                            ambitious students who desire to make an impact at NJIT. We do this by planning and hosting engaging 
                            experiences throughout the semester, aimed at bringing the campus community together.
                            I have also attended professional conferences including the National Association for Campus Activities (NACA) in Hartford where I was able to network with other
                            student activities councils, meet with vendors, and get ideas on more events to bring to NJIT.
