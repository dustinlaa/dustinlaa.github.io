                    <p>
                    In Summer 2021 and 2022, I worked as an Orientation Leader for NJIT's New Student Orientation and help guided over 1,600 incoming students support their educational and personal goals
                    <br></br>
                    From end of the semester Spring 2021 to Fall 2022, I was of the event coordinators for the NJIT Student Activities Council and I helped establish and facilitate 17 school-wide events for 500+ students
                    <br></br>
                    These positions helped with my time management, teamwork, and leadership skills. I'm looking to make an impact in a software development position that will allow me to apply and enhance my programming skills.

                                    Used Python with the Pygame library to create a game where a user toasts their marshmallow to a scrumptious golden brown.
                                
                                    Choose a duration of short, medium, or long to toast your marshmallow over the campfire.
                                
                                    Based on this duration, you will toast your marshmallow and get it closer to Golden Brown!
                                
                                    But be careful, too much toasting will burn your marshmallow.
                                
                                    Continue to toast golden brown marshmallows to increase your streak and go for a high score!

                                    Users play a simple HTML game for points and can register accounts to save their scores.  Users can create public and private profiles as well as competitions to challenge
                                    other users. There is also a weekly, monthly, and lifetime scoreboard for the game. For users with admin privileges, 
                                    they can create roles, edit competitions, and assign other users as admins.

                                                I have contacted agencies for different acts and supplies to help run 500+ person, school-wide events.
                                                These events include Do It Yourself (DIY) Days, Game Shows, Movie Nights, and more!

                                            I had the opportunity to be on a FIRST Robotics Competition Team in my high school years. During this competiton, teams are given a game each year and the challenge of
                                            creating a robot to compete in competitions all around the world. FIRST greatly encourages teamwork, problem solving, learning, and leadership.

                                                    I became the Chairman's Award Leader during my senior year where I oversaw the production of a video, essay, and presentation to compete for this award.
                                                    This award showcased how my team is creating leaders and transforming the culture in ways that will inspire greater levels in STEM.

                                                    FIRST Robotics has helped me gain a higher interest in STEM and has made a big impact in my life over the 4 years I was competing in high school.
